# Final Project Name

## Description

youngStar is a website for youngsters to visualize schoolwork successes and failures and be rewarded for their successes. The goal of youngStar is for children in elementary and middle school to learn early in life that hard work and good grades will be rewarded. 

In the first use of youngStar, parents will setup points for graded assignments. For example, homework assignments could have the follow points: A= 10 points, B= 5 points, C=0 points, D= -5, F= -10. These points can vary between homework, tests and projects and can be edited at any point. In this initial set up, parents will also set the rewards to be achieved by these points. 

These rewards and points will be displayed to the youngster on their point board so they understand what they are working towards and what it will take to accomplish that goal. **

The point board will have boxes for each 

Every time an assignment or test comes home graded, parents and their youngsters will login to youngStar. Parents will keep their password a secret and must be present while the youngster is logging in. The youngster will be in charge of entering in their graded assignment (what class it was in, what type of assignment it was and the grade they recieved) and submit the pre-determined points on their board. 

Once the youngster has recieved the correct amount of points to redeem a reward, the reward will highlight. They can redeem their rewards by dragging and dropping the points over to it. Once they drag and drop their points, the points will disapear from the board and overall points on the reward will drop until 0. 

Once the reward reaches 0, something cool will happen.
